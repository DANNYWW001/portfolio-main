            During my time as a CBT Center Support Staff, I gained valuable
            experience working in a collaborative environment with colleagues
            and students. The role strengthened my teamwork, communication, and

          <p>
            After concluding my time with 18 IT, I decided to pursue a career as
            a Full-Stack Developer. During this period, I focused on building a
            solid foundation in web technologies, starting with HTML, CSS,
            Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. I advanced into learning React and its
            core functional components, applying these skills in small projects
            to strengthen my problem-solving and UI development abilities. This
            phase marked the beginning of my journey in creating accessible,
            responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

          <p>
            As a Frontend Developer, I strengthened my skills by working on
            multiple projects using React, its components, and libraries. I
            gained hands-on experience with API integration, animations, and
            styling tools like Tailwind CSS, while also learning deployment and
            hosting through GitHub and Vercel. Beyond coding, I grew my ability
            to collaborate in teams, navigate Figma designs, and translate ideas
            into responsive, user-friendly applications.

            To strengthen my frontend skills and transition into backend
            development, I joined Tech Studio as an intern. There, I worked with
            Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while also using tools like
            Postman for API testing and Render for deployment. Alongside backend
            tasks, I continued improving my frontend expertise, contributing to
            projects that required collaboration and problem-solving. This
            internship marked a significant step forward in my journey toward
            becoming a Full-Stack Engineer, giving me practical experience in
            building more complex systems while fueling my commitment to
